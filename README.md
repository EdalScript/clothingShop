# Clothing Store eCommerce

This fictional clothing store contains all the essentials a scalable idea might ever need-- authentication, data management, reusable components, a payment gateway integration (Stripe) and more! </br>
</br>
As challenging as it sounds, I work on this project a couple of hours every day and as soon as the project is ready for production, a link will be added right here.


### Stack specification: 
-React (with Hooks) </br>
-Redux for state management </br>
-Firebase for user authentication and data management </br>
-Sass for nested styling </br>

### Work on progress
